Victor was born  
in spring of 44  
and never saw  
his father anymore  
the greatest sacrifice  
a child of war  
another son who never had  
a father after Leningrad

Went off to school  
and learned to serve the state  
follow the rules  
and drank his wodka straight  
the only way to live  
was drown the hate  
The Russian life was very sad  
and such was life in Leningrad
